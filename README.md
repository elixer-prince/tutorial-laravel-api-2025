# Test Repo (Laravel API 2025)

I followed a tutorial on YouTube to test Laravel API because I had used Laravel and the TALL stack, which had automatic integration. However I needed to learn how to integrate my Laravel Knowledge with my React experience to get the best of both worlds!

The test was successful and I learnt how to connect to this repo locally with Axios.
